# Sample project using flask and templates

This is a copy from the excercise executed in the next video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1RJmh_OqeA

I'm trying to implement a simple MS platform, so in the research i found things like venv (a wonderful stuff in python), flask and fameworks to work with ORM technics.

This is part of my results, in other repo it will be upgraded.
